# Execute plan phases

Plan: `$1`
Phases requested: `$2`
Full arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Load and follow the `execute-feature` skill in **plan mode**, together with
`CLAUDE.md`. Invoking this command is the owner's explicit request to commit:
**one commit per phase, made by you (the orchestrator) right after that phase
passes, followed by a plain `git push`.** Those are the only git writes
allowed. Never force-push, branch, amend, reset, stash or touch other refs.
Subagents never run git writes.

**Unattended by default.** The owner often leaves this running overnight. Never
pause to ask "should I continue?", for confirmation to commit, or for approval
between phases. Run every requested phase back to back. Stop only on a real
block (failed checks after 2 correction rounds, or an open `BLOCKED (Dn)`
decision), and then say so in the report. If a commit is denied for any reason,
keep going without it and list the uncommitted phases in the final report.
If a push is denied, keep going and list the unpushed commits in the report.

## 1. Resolve the phase list

- `N` → that phase only. `N-M` → N through M in order. `N,M` → exactly those,
  in order. `next` → the first `PENDING` phase whose dependencies are all
  `DONE`.
- Run nothing outside that list, even if it's small or obviously next.

## 2. Gate (before touching code)

Read the plan's header, `Owner decisions`, `Global constraints`, and the
requested phases in full. For each requested phase:

- It exists, and its status is `PENDING` or an interrupted `IN_PROGRESS`
  (which you reset to `PENDING`). If it's already `DONE`, skip it and say so.
- Every `Depends on:` phase is `DONE`. A dependency that is also in the
  requested list and comes earlier counts once it finishes.
- It's not `BLOCKED (Dn)`. If a decision Dn is still open, stop and restate
  the decision with the options. Continue only if the owner's message resolves
  it; then record the answer under that decision in the plan.

If the gate fails, stop and report. Don't partially run a phase.

## 3. Run each phase, in order

1. Set `Status: IN_PROGRESS` in the phase and on the status board.
2. Delegate its steps to the role named in the phase, following the
   execute-feature per-task loop: embed the phase's **Contract** and AC text
   in the prompt, verify deterministically, review with `code-reviewer`, and
   allow at most 2 correction rounds.
3. Stay inside the phase. Anything outside its contract gets reported, not
   built. Never write tests, never add dependencies, never run destructive Docker/data
   commands, never send real WhatsApp messages.
4. When it passes: run the project's existing tests plus the deterministic
   checks from `project-core` for the changed files (running tests is fine;
   never write or modify them). Set `Status: DONE` and add a short `Evidence:`
   line under it (checks and tests run with results, the observable outcome),
   then update the status board.
5. **Commit the phase** (only after step 4 is green):
    - `git status` / `git diff` first; stage only this phase's files by explicit
      path (including `plan.md`), never `git add -A` or `.`. Don't stage
      unrelated changes or secrets (`.env`).
    - One commit per phase, English, conventional style matching the repo log
      (e.g. `feat(dashboard): ...`), subject naming the phase, body with a short
      summary. End with the attribution line from the session's system-reminder.
    - Don't use `--no-verify`. If a hook fails, fix the cause and make a new
      commit; never amend.
    - If tests/checks fail after the correction rounds, do **not** commit:
      follow the block rule below.
6. If it fails or needs a decision: set `Status: BLOCKED` with a one-line
   reason plus options and a recommendation, then stop. Don't move on to
   later requested phases that depend on it.

Keep the owner oriented with one line per boundary, e.g.
"Phase 4 DONE — committed abc1234 — 4/13 phases".

If your remaining budget looks too small for the next requested phase, stop
cleanly after the current one and say which phases are left. Never leave a
phase half done.

## 4. Stop and report

After the last requested phase (or a block), stop. Don't start other phases.
Report:

- the phases done and blocked, with evidence;
- the ACs now satisfied, as far as the executed phases go;
- non-blocking review findings left open;
- anything the owner should check manually now;
- the next dependency-ready phase and the exact command to run it;
- the commits made (hash + subject per phase) and whether each was pushed.
