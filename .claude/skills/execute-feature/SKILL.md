name: execute-feature
description: Use when asked to execute, implement or continue a feature documented under docs/features/<feature>/, or phases of a plan.md produced by /plan-spec. Orchestrates delegate → verify → review → correct; commits only via /execute-phases (one per phase).

# Execute feature

You are the **orchestrator**. Product behaviour comes from the spec; you decide
only implementation-level details (task boundaries, order, naming, small
extractions). Global rules in `CLAUDE.md` always win — in particular: **never
commit (except per phase under `/execute-phases`), never run git writes, never
edit the spec to match code, never write tests unless asked, never send real
WhatsApp messages.**

## Two entry modes

| Mode                            | Task graph lives in                       | Status recorded in                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Feature (`docs/features/<f>/`)  | `.claude/state/<f>.md` (you derive it)    | `.claude/state/<f>.md`                   |
| Plan phases (`/execute-phases`) | the phases of `plan.md` (already derived) | each phase's `Status:` line in `plan.md` |

## Entry gate

- Feature mode: `docs/features/<feature>/spec.md` must exist with acceptance
  criteria and no placeholders. Optional `tech-design.md` is binding when
  present. Missing/incomplete → **STOP**, report exactly what's missing.
- Plan mode: `plan.md` must exist; every requested phase must exist and have
  all `Depends on:` phases `DONE`. A phase `BLOCKED` on an owner decision →
  **STOP** and restate the decision needed.

## 0. Start or resume

1. Read the spec (feature mode) or the plan header + requested phases (plan
   mode) in full. Re-read spec sections a phase cites only when its embedded
   contract is insufficient.
2. Load `n8n-workflows` and/or `whatsapp-gateway` for workflow and messaging
   work, `project-core` for the checks.
3. Inspect the repo for what the task touches (not the whole repo).
4. Feature mode only: record `spec.md` SHA-256 and derive tasks into
   `.claude/state/<feature>.md` — each task: outcome, domain, depends on,
   covers ACs, completion evidence, `Status: PENDING`, `Correction round: 0`.
   Map every AC to at least one task before implementing.
5. Resume: any `IN_PROGRESS` → back to `PENDING`, then continue with the next
   dependency-ready `PENDING` item. Don't redo valid `DONE` work.

## 1. Per task / phase loop

1. **Scope** — mark `IN_PROGRESS`. Collect its ACs and embedded contract.
2. **Delegate** by scope (one task may run roles sequentially):

    | Scope                                                         | Role            |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
    | workflow JSON, webhooks, n8n nodes, compose/env (n8n, gateway) | `n8n-workflows` |
    | TypeScript service, custom nodes, scripts, tooling config     | `node-service`  |

    The prompt includes: the task, its AC text, the exact contract (workflow
    names, webhook paths, payload shapes, node names, copy strings), the
    invariants that apply, and "implement only this scope; never run git
    writes; never send real messages".

3. **Verify** deterministically with the commands in `project-core` for the
   files actually changed. Failures go back to the same role before review.
4. **Review** with `code-reviewer`: task + AC text + contract + scoped diff
   (`git diff -- <paths>`, plus new untracked files) + check results.
5. **Close** — `APPROVED` → `DONE` with completion evidence (commands run,
   results, observable outcome). `CHANGES_REQUIRED` → correction loop.

Report one progress line at each boundary ("Phase 4 DONE — 4/13 phases").

## 2. Correction loop

Max **2** correction rounds per task (fix → verify → re-review). After the
second failed re-review stop patching. Continue automatically only if the fix
stays below the product boundary (different implementation, same behaviour).
Otherwise mark `BLOCKED` with the finding, options and a recommendation, and
stop. Stop-and-ask triggers: spec ambiguity, conflicting ACs, scope change, a
needed dependency, anything destructive, anything that would message a real
contact.

## 3. Final review (last task of a feature / final plan phase)

1. Full diff + every check listed in `project-core`.
2. `code-reviewer` over all ACs and the full diff: ACs nobody owns, later tasks
   breaking earlier ones, duplicated logic, dead nodes/scaffolding.
3. Re-read the spec end to end as if new; any requirement not observably
   delivered becomes a new task through the loop above. Repeat until nothing
   is missing or a genuine blocker exists.

## 4. Report

Tasks/phases done, AC status, checks run with results, non-blocking findings
left open, blockers, what the owner should test manually (e.g. send a message
from the test number). Remind that nothing was committed (under
`/execute-phases`: list the per-phase commits instead). **Never commit, branch
or push** unless the owner asks in that exact message.
